      "A humble home for new, challenging puzzles, including an new game I created called Wordpunch. I built this website using React + TypeScript + Next.js + TailwindCSS and deployed it using Vercel. This combination was extremely efficient. By design, this project supports server-side rendering and it is worthy to note that Wordpunch simply uses local storage to track user activity. If you have a game idea and want to turn it into reality, I designed this website for easy collaboration. This way, other engineers can have an opportunity to add their own ideas! In the future, I would like to complete additional features like stats and game popularity rankings.",

With a React + JavaScript frontend and Node + Express backend, this LLM project lets you drag in any PDF, ask any question, and get a solid answer. For example, you can drag in a research paper and ask, can you summarize this for a 5-year-old? Under the hood, the frontend handles user input while the server handles parsing the PDF and using the OpenAI API to generate AI-based answers. I had to address certain challenges, such as how to handle very long PDFs. I am excited to keep improving this project!",

Even if you can keep up, it is not always the most convenient to go back in time to revisit links from months ago.

I love Figma as a design tool, but designers are limited in that it is challenging to showcase component animations, interactions, and different states in action. Additionally, engineers have to code these from scratch. I collaborated with a team of 5 engineers to develop both a Figma plugin and web client to tackle this problem, starting with button components as a simple use case. Once a user uploads their button design from Figma via the plugin, the web client leverages Figma design metadata to generate their button in React code. In addition, it generates different states and animations for you by default (e.g., hover animations) which you can edit using our component editor. I mainly worked on the animations and transitions aspect of the tool, which allows users to control how their button works. Out tool was accepted into the Figma community and was available to the public for some time.",

So, as part of Vanderbilt University research, I led a team to complete a multi-purpose application for the touchscreen in the orangutan exhibit. It has orangutan-friendly games to play, music to listen to, and videos to watch. Behind the scenes, a log is collecting data to observe their behavior. It turns out that they liked it, so our model and learnings could be applied to other primate exhibits around the world. My teammate and I ended up presenting our work at CogSci 2019 in Montreal.

I looked to tools like GarageBand for creating custom drumming, but that solution did not work for a few reasons, and there were no apps that existed to fix our problem. DRUMMR, the iOS app, was made to drop whatever groove you wanted, so you could have a drummer present whenever you or your band needed it. DRUMMR was as simple as it gets. Just choose the genre, style, meter, and speed you want, and it played the drums for you. Plug into some loud speakers, and things got real. If you wanted to blast some heavy rock in 3/4, rap some verses in 13/4, or practice a solo in 9/4, DRUMMR could handle it all.",
