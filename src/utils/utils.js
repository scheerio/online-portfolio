These experiences were made to be used anywhere, anytime, no headset needed. My niche was the music industry. To get the attention of high-profile artists, I had to sell the idea over dozens of phone calls and create over a hundred demos. The result: I collaborated with several artists (including a member of the Dave Matthews Band) and was lucky enough to have Skype calls with several of my musical idols. I have never been so star struck.',

In fact, in their Zoo Atlanta exhibit, there is a touchscreen built inside one of their trees for them to use. However, they did not have fun games on it! So, as part of Vanderbilt University research, I led a team to complete a multi-purpose application for the touchscreen in the orangutan exhibit. It has orangutan-friendly games to play, music to listen to, and videos to watch. Behind the scenes, a log is collecting data to observe their behavior. It turns out that they liked it, so our model and learnings could be applied to other primate exhibits around the world. My teammate and I ended up presenting our work at CogSci 2019 in Montreal. I am the primary author on the paper about it, published by the Cognitive Science Society.',

My friends and I used to get together for music jam sessions (I play piano), but not having a drummer present made it much more difficult to practice together. I looked to tools like GarageBand for creating custom drumming, but that solution did not work for a few reasons, and there were no apps that existed to fix our problem. DRUMMR, the iOS app, was made to drop whatever groove you wanted, so you could have a drummer present whenever you or your band needed it. DRUMMR was as simple as it gets. Just choose the genre, style, meter, and speed you want, and it played the drums for you. Plug into some loud speakers, and things got real. If you wanted to blast some heavy rock in 3/4, rap some verses in 13/4, or practice a solo in 9/4, DRUMMR could handle it all.',
